DBoilerplate3 documentation!
============================

Welcome to the dboilerplate3 documentation. dboilerplate is a django project
template that contains the most commonly used tools and configurations that we
use at Havas Worldwide London.

You can request us to add new features or change stuff around, if it's a good
idea we'll do it!. This boilerplate has tons of tiny changes to help us so
please pay attention when you read!.

Requirements
------------

This project requires Django 1.7 and Python 3.3 or higher to run. If you're
looking for support for django 1.6 or less and python 2.7 please take a look
to the original dboilerplate project in `here <https://github.com/clione/dboilerplate>`_

This documentation should be fairly valid fot both versions of the boilderplate.
