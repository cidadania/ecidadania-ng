Creating apps
=============

By default django contains a `startapp` command, but in dboilerplate we
created an application generator. This comes in handy to save the first 15
minutes of development of the application. It will ask you for some values
and create the the application skeleton and the code inside it for you.

How to use it
-------------

To create application using the generator you just have to run the management
command from /src
::

    $ ./manage.py addapp

It will ask you the values and create all for you.
