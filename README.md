Current version: 0.2.0 alpha

Django version: 1.7.4

Python version: 3.4.x


ecidadania-ng (ecidadania new generation) is a project to develop an up to date
version of the well known open source application for citizen participation,
ecidadania which can be used for debates, proposals, trusted voting,
usable by associations, companies and administrations.

ecidadania objective is to provide a way to make a full participation
process on internet, or even use it as a complement to in person participative
processes.

We don't have any documentation in place yet because we're adapting the whole
source code to the new codebase, and it will take a while.
